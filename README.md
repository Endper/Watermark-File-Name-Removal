# Watermark File Name Removal (WFNR) 
## Version 0.0.0
> Currently being worked on. Completed : ~20%

Used to remove watermarks that are injected in a file name downloaded from a website
___
This originally started of as a small python macro project for personal use. However, I have decided to turn this into an open-source project for anyone to use.

Some websites inject some sort of watermark before (or after) the name of the actual files that you download. This program is useful to automate the process of renaming them - saves time.


# How to Run It

As the .py itself or
as an executable of some sort.
(Still working on the executable part).



# Requirements

If you want to modify it or use it, make sure you have these installed on your computer:

Mainly just tkinter. Install it through
`pip install tkinter` ,
the program also uses the OS built-in library.
